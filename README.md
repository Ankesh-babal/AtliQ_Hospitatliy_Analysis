# AtliQ_Hospitatliy_Analysis
### Overview
This project focuses on enhancing the decision-making process for Atliq Grands, a chain of five-star hotels in India. With challenges in market share and revenue due to strategic moves by competitors and ineffective management decisions, Atliq Grands aims to incorporate Business and Data Intelligence.

The project involves building a data-driven dashboard to provide insights from the historical data provided, empowering the revenue management team to make informed decisions.

### Features
Developed a mock-up dashboard based on the stakeholders' requirements.
Built visualizations for Overall Analysis and Monthly Analysis views.
Created additional insights beyond the provided mock-up for deeper analysis.
Integrated advanced features like bookmarks and page navigation for a seamless user experience.
Maintained a consistent design using a predefined color palette.

### Learnings from the Project
Calendar Visual: Developed a calendar visual using a matrix table, enabling detailed date-based analysis. This innovative approach was inspired by an article.
Cancellation Policies: Gained insights into cancellation policies across various hotels. Most hotels charge no fee if a booking is canceled at least three months before the booking date. Cancellations beyond this period incur charges ranging between 60% and 90% of the booking cost.
Bookmarks and Selection: Mastered the use of bookmarks and selection tools for advanced functionality, including page navigation and a clear filter button in the dashboard. Techniques were learned through resources like YouTube tutorials.
Consistent Design: Experimented with a predefined color palette, ensuring a professional and consistent design throughout the dashboard.
